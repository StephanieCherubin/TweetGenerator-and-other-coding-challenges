'''Given a non-empty array of ones and zeroes where ones represent islands and zeroes represent water, find the width and the height of the island if there can only be one island.'''

'''width: 2
length: 3'''

'''Knowns:
Islands are rectangular.
The 1 can have at most 8 neighbors.'''

'''Gameplan:
Traverse the array horizontally, removing the 1s if there is a 1 before or after it'''

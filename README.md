## Best Practices for Technical Interviews

**1. Restate the Question**
Restate the given question by putting it into your own words. I like to use the words, input, function, 
and output in my explanation.

**2. Ask Clarifying Questions**
What is the input type?
What is the return type?
Is the input sorted?
Should the return be sorted?
Can I use any higher order function or one liner return?
What should I return if there are no values?
Will the input always have values or can I be given an empty input?

**3. State Assumptions**
Stating assumptions demonstrates good judgement, and attention to detail.
It simplifies your problem to produce a solution.

**4. Thinking Out Loud**
- ***Brainstorm solutions*** - No code. Try to explain how you would go about solving the solution.
Using common data structures.  
- ***Explain rationale*** - Explain why you chose a certain data structure / algorithm / operation. Saying what and why. 
- ***Discuss tradeoffs*** - Comparing between solutions. Talking about the pros and cons / runtime complexity / space complexity.
- ***Suggest Improvement*** - Say how you would improve your solution and how it would affect other parts of code or complexities.


### Things I learned from good technical practices:
- Pseudocode before writing any code.
- Test the code. 
- Make sure to use Many Different Kinds of Tests When Checking the Code as in 
If the input is an array, make sure to use a non-sorted array with both positive and negative values in various ranges.
- Discuss tradeoffs using space and time complexity

## Common Behavioral Interview Questions

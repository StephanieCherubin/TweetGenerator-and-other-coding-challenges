'''Fully solve at least two of the below linked lists problems in real working code. Use your idea sketches and pseudocode from class, type it in your code editor, run some test cases, and debug your code so it works correctly. Implement at least one solution for 2 or more of the problems below.

Given an array of k singly-linked lists, each of whose values are in sorted order, combine all nodes (do not create new nodes) into one singly-linked list with all values in order.'''

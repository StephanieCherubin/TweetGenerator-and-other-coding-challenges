'''Fully solve at least two of the below linked lists problems in real working code. Use your idea sketches and pseudocode from class, type it in your code editor, run some test cases, and debug your code so it works correctly. Implement at least one solution for 2 or more of the problems below.

Given a singly-linked list, find the middle value in the list.
Example: If the given linked list is A → B → C → D → E, return C.
Assumptions: The length (n) is odd so the linked list has a definite middle.

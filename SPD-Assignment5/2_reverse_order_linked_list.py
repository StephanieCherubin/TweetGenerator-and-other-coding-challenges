'''Fully solve at least two of the below linked lists problems in real working code. Use your idea sketches and pseudocode from class, type it in your code editor, run some test cases, and debug your code so it works correctly. Implement at least one solution for 2 or more of the problems below

Given a singly-linked list, reverse the order of the list by modifying the nodes’ links.

Example: If the given linked list is A → B → C → D → E, nodes should be modified/rearranged so the list becomes E → D → C → B → A.
